    <h3>A rich and spicy spaghetti.</h3>
    <p>This deceptive spaghetti is incredibly simple.  And far more flavorful than you can imagine.  And all that in only one pan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Tomato puree</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wide pan, gently warm your oil with minced garlic and any other spices you may want such as chili falkes or pepper.</li>
        <li>When the garlic starts to brown, add some tomato puree and fry your noodles, keeping them organized in a nice row.  When they start to go crispy, carefully turn them over, again keeping them organized for an even cook.</li>
        <li>Now that your spaghetti is nicely fried, you will add a couple cups of broth (water and tomata paste).  Simmer it off, then add some more.  At this point, your noodles should start to become flexible.  Just continue to add broth and simmer off until your pasta is at its desired consistency.</li>
